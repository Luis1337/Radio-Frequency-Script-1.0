[B][SIZE="5"][COLOR="Orange"]Radio Frequencies[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]
At the moment, this is a [b]very[/b] simple piece of code, two commands, one enum & one variable. It uses [url=http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=602923][b]sscanf[/b][/url], [url=http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=570868][b]foreach[/b][/url] & [url=http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=91354][b]zcmd[/b][/url].

What this filterscript does it allows you and other players to talk on a radio, you'll have to be on the same frequency though other wise you'll be talking to a complete stranger! With the use of the [b]/setfreq[/b] command, you're able to set a frequency. Then using the [b]/radio[/b] command you can the chat to those on the same frequency.

Any suggestions are more than welcome. I'm sure there'll be quite a few.
